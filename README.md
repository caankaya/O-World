### 🚀 Project Introduction

oWorld is designed to be a one-stop shop for learning more about each country on our planet. The application allows you to quickly visualize various information such as population, GDP, language, currency, and much more. We started with basic information and plan to evolve the application to display more detailed information such as important historical dates, cultural anecdotes, health data, etc.

What sets our application apart is its extraterrestrial theme. Imagine that extraterrestrials are studying Earth and sharing this information with us! We use special fonts and animations to give the impression that the information is being translated from an extraterrestrial language. The user interface employs the glassmorphism design style, which gives the impression of an extraterrestrial spaceship display.

### 🤔 Why did we create oWorld?

Although there are already websites that present information on different countries, they are often disorganized and unattractive. Tools like Google Earth are excellent for geographical visualization, but do not centrally provide detailed information on each country. oWorld aims to fill this gap by offering a visually engaging, structured, and detailed presentation of information on each country.

### 🎯 Objectives

Our goal is to provide quick and convenient access to a plethora of data on each country in an educational and entertaining way. By presenting data in a visually appealing manner, oWorld makes information searching simple and enjoyable.

### 🎒 Target Audience

oWorld is intended for anyone curious to learn more about the world. It is particularly useful for educational purposes and is an excellent tool for students studying geography. However, with its rich and engaging content, it is suitable for anyone, regardless of age or interests.
